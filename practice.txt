PROGRAM
1.Given a string of even length, return a string made of the middle two chars, so the string "string" yields "ri". The string length will be at least 2.
middleTwo("string") ? "ri"
middleTwo("code") ? "od"
middleTwo("Practice") ? "ct"
2.WAJP TO CHECK THE NUMBER IS GREATER OR LESSER OR EQUAL BY USING SWITCH -CASE
3.WAJP TO CHECK THE NUMBER IS EVEN OR ODD USING SWITCH CASE
4.Given an array of scores, compute the int average of the first half and the second half, and return whichever is larger. We'll say that the second half begins at index length/2. The array length will be at least 2. To practice decomposition, write a separate helper method
int average(int[] scores, int start, int end) { which computes the average of the elements between indexes start..end. Call your helper method twice to implement scoresAverage(). Write your helper method after your scoresAverage() method in the JavaBat text area. Normally you would compute averages with doubles, but here we use ints so the expected results are exact.
scoresAverage([2, 2, 4, 4]) ? 4
scoresAverage([4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 2]) ? 4
scoresAverage([3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3]) ? 4
5.WAJP FOR BELOW SCENARIO
	a.create a class Vote
	b.declare a variable age
	c.Age limit to vote is 18 years,now chack the age of a person
	if the person's age is greater or exactly 18 then print " person is eligible " else print "not eligible"
6.WAJP FOR BELOW SCENARIO
	a.create class Student
	b.declare the variables student_marks and student_age
	c.if student_marks is greater than or equal to 90 and student_age is exactly equal to 21 then "student eligible for scholorship"
	else "not eligible for scholorship"
